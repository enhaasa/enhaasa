<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I'm Enhasa, a self-taught ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª Swedish web developer currently living in ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany. I enjoy solving problems, exploring music, and playing games when I get the chance.
</p>

<p>
  My coding journey wasn't anything extraordinary. It started with a few problems I needed to solve and the thought, <i>"Fuck it, I'll figure it out."</i> It was a lot of trial and error, but over time, I found myself falling in love with the process of creating and improving. Iâ€™m still learning, but I enjoy every step along the way.
</p>

<p>
  I try to focus on building practical applications that can make a difference, no matter how small. My work is mostly with React/TypeScript/SCSS on the frontend, NodeJS/Websockets on the backend, and relational databases to keep everything running smoothly. 
</p>

<p>
  I'm always learning and refining my skills, and I'm grateful for the amazing community of developers who inspire and support me.
