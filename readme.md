<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I'm Enhasa, a self-taught ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª Swedish web developer currently situated in ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany. I'm a problem solver, a music enthusiast, and the occasional gamer. 
</p>

<p>
  My coding journey didn't start with any one destinctive decision, but rather a series of problems needing solutions, and a whole lot of <i>"Fuck it, I'll do it myself."</i>. Much of my progress came from the sheer need to make my projects functional, and it eventually sparked a passion for development.
</p>

<p>
  I'm passionate about creating practical, multi-user applications with a <u>real purpose</u>. My toolkit includes working with React/Typescript/SCSS frontends, NodeJS/Websocket backends, and relational databases for persistent storage.
