<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I'm Enhasa, a self-taught ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª Swedish web developer currently situated in ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany. I'm a problem solver, a music enthusiast, and the occasional gamer. 
</p>

<p>
  My early journey in coding was often guided by necessity rather than destinctive decisions (and a whole lot of <i>"Fuck it, I'll do it myself."</i>). Much of my progress came from the sheer need to make my projects functional. 
  Ensuring that the tools I built actually worked took precedence over any uncertainties about my ability to make them work. The demands of the work left me little room to dwell on the challenges; instead, I've always focused on getting the job done.
</p>

<p>
  I'm a strong believer in learning <b>concepts over specific languages</b>, a philosophy that has guided me through the ever-changing landscape of technology. This approach has also helped me greatly when learning new frameworks and languages.
</p>

<p>
  I'm passionate about creating practical, multi-user applications with a real purpose. My toolkit includes working with React/Typescript/SCSS frontends, NodeJS/Websocket backends, and relational databases for persistent storage. 
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me discovering new tunes, plucking my guitar, or planning my next project. I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers, potential collaborators, and anyone who shares the same passion for turning ideas into reality.
